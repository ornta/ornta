# About me


**ornta/ornta** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I'm going through The Odin Project to learn web development.
- 🌱 I’m working on learning how to code in Python.
- ⚡ Fun facts: I'm a TK Teacher in a non-classroom based charter school, my favorite sport is Snowboarding, I'm a hobby baker and I like listening to podcasts about economics 🏂 👩‍🏫 🤓
